# Simple Angular App
minimal angular boilerplate to be incremently updated in future to cover all my requirements.

# How To Run
`npm start` will do the trick and do npm install and bower install on the background.

# Customized Boilerplate from Angular Seed 
This project is based on angular seed skeleton for angular apps, check the repo here for installations and how to run tests [Angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

# Tests
unit tests `npm run test`
and for e2e `npm run protractor`
In order to run Protractor tests you need to install latest JDK, please follow these instruction [End to end testing](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed#end-to-end-testing)

for Protractor tests, you will need to install Java sdk in you Environement, check the below links.

Hint: you will also need to make sure the app is running as in `npm start` because protractor will run a routine to go localhost:8000 and do tests over the app.
